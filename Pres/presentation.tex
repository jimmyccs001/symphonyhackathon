\begin{itemize}
\item Technical functions will make or break the industry of tomorrow
\item Open-source driven innovation... In banking? % A lot of the current innovation is made off open source contributions, esp in data science e.g. google tensorflow etc
% maybe also mention collaborative stuff such as stack overflow here
\begin{itemize}
\item Kickstart new projects seamlessly
\item Identify opportunities for cooperation
\item Easily onboard new team members
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Why is knowledge diffusion currently clunky?
\begin{itemize}
\item Teams built in silo across space and activity % Yet often common ground between activities, need transversality and more communication
\item Documentation: unsufficient and uncentralized % Many pages but no central repository and unsufficient tools to look through them. Solution: curation + incentivize good doc
\item (Think we need a third point here to balance the slide)
\end{itemize}
\item We believe that Symphony can help smooth out these pain points
\end{itemize}

\item Shift from a culture of secrecy to a culture of sharing and collaboration
\item Questions?
\end{itemize}
